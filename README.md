# workout_randomizer

I've been unable to find a full body workout randomizer that meets all my requirements, so I figured I'd make one. This program is going to be very basic at first and will be added to when I find free time.

Requirements:
- Easy to edit exercise lists
- Workouts are full body. *One exercise for each major muscle group*
- Generates 3 workouts for the week with no repeat exercises 

Future Features:
- Workout generates Sunday night and is emailed to specified email address
- Links to excercise demonstration videos
- Add support for "X" day workouts 
- Speed optimizations. This program is simple, but good programming practices should be implimented. Once I have my spaghetti working, I plan on recoding with proper class implementation and the like.
